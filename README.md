Carnegie Mellon Coding Academy (4th Edition) Answers (Updated Frequently)


Hey there! I'm Sharky, a student that loves coding. I personally sometimes struggle on a few projects for CMU CS Academy so here is some help!

In order to go get answers, you need to click on the branch button and go to the one you need. Contact me for help.

PS: You can't copy and paste because CMU CS declines any pasting from outside sources so you have to type it. If you contact me I will write it on call with you.
